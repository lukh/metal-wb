# FreeCAD Metal Workbench

## Short Description

MetalWB is a workbench for creation of welded frames and structures.

It uses profiles mapped onto sketchs as a base, and handles cut, trim, operations.

## Install

Clone or copy the repository in the local Mod folder of FreeCAD

## Credits

This repo and source code is heavily (like, really) based on the work of [this repo](https://framagit.org/Veloma/freecad_metal_workbench): The work was done by Veloma and Jonathan Wiedemann.

## Coming soon...

In its final version, it should allow to cover the whole welding design workflow :

1) Skeleton creation with sketch lines or geometrical primitives;
2) Application of a profile on the skeleton, to create a part;
3) Adjustment functions (e.g. removal of overlaps) or addition of specific elements (gusset, weld bead, etc.);
4) Export of a spreadsheet that lists each part of the assembly, identifies the profiles and their length.
